{"google":"","name":"Placeholder Display Ads","body":"For use on Prototypes and Development/Staging Websites, Mobile Sites, and Apps\r\n==============================================================================\r\n \r\nWe've all done it. We screen shot static ads from other sites. We pull archived ads off of [Moat](http://www.moat.com/). \r\n \r\nWe fill our prototypes and development sites/apps with these static placeholders. \r\n \r\nWhy use these?\r\n--------------\r\n \r\nThree reasons: \r\n- They are ugly (like most real ads).\r\n- They animate and move in annoying ways (like most real ads).\r\n- They are good for testing/qc.\r\n \r\nTo the third, you can randomly/dynamically swap between sizes as needed. So when you have an ad unit that could hold a 300x250 or a 300x600 or a 300x1050? Then use these ads to see how each of those sizes may effect your templates. \r\n \r\nWhat's included?\r\n----------------\r\n \r\nThese placeholders follow the [IAB guidelines](http://www.iab.net/guidelines/508676/508767/displayguidelines) (as of January 2013). \r\n \r\n* Universal Ad Package: \r\n * 300x250 (medium rectange)\r\n * 180x150 (rectangle)\r\n * 160x600 (wide skyscraper)\r\n * 728x90 (leaderboard)\r\n* Display Rising Stars\r\n * 970x250 (billboard)\r\n * 970x90 (super leaderboard / pushdown / slider / pencil)\r\n * 300x600 (half page / flimstrip)\r\n * 300x1050 (portrait)\r\n* Other Ad Units\r\n * 120x60 (button 2)\r\n * 88x31 (micro bar)\r\n\r\nContributing\r\n------------\r\n\r\nWant to contribute? Great!\r\n\r\nAs the IAB ads new sizes and units, please feel free to get those into the mix here.\r\n\r\nAlso, we need to create some placeholder for [responsive ads](http://www.responsiveads.com/).","note":"Don't delete this file!
