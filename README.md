Placeholder Display Ads for Websites, Mobile Sites, and Web/Mobile Apps
=======================================================================
 
We've all done it. We screen shot static ads from other sites. We pull archived ads off of [Moat](http://www.moat.com/). 
 
We fill our prototypes and development sites/apps with these static placeholders. 
 
Why use these?
--------------
 
Three reasons: 
- They are ugly (like most real ads).
- They animate and move in annoying ways (like most real ads).
- They are good for testing/qc.
 
To the third, you can randomly/dynamically swap between sizes as needed. So when you have an ad unit that could hold a 300x250 or a 300x600 or a 300x1050? Then use these ads to see how each of those sizes may effect your templates. 
 
What's included?
----------------
 
These placeholders follow the [IAB guidelines](http://www.iab.net/guidelines/508676/508767/displayguidelines) (as of January 2013).

Want to contribute? Great!

As the IAB ads new sizes and units, please feel free to get those into the mix here.

Also, we need to create some placeholder for [responsive ads](http://www.responsiveads.com/).
